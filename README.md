  # ðŸŽ² Monopoly Board Simulation

  This project simulates a player moving on a **40-field Monopoly board** based on two dice rolls. The simulation runs for **100     and 1,000,000 rolls**, analyzing the probability \( p(i) \) of landing on each field in two cases:  
    1. **Standard movement**  
    2. **With Jail** â€“ Landing on field **30 ("Go to Jail")** moves the player to **field 10 ("Jail")**
